## Technologies Used

The project primarily utilizes front-end web technologies:

- **HTML5:** Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS3:** Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript:** Front-end logic and interactivity.
- **JSON:** Static data storage.
- **Node.js (Optional):** A simple server might be used for local development or handling basic requests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you will need:

- A web browser.
- A local web server (e.g., Node.js http-server, Python's `http.server`, or a live server extension for your IDE).
- (Optional) Node.js and npm if you plan to use the provided `server.js` or manage dependencies.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
bash
   cd <project_directory>
   
```
3. (Optional) If using Node.js and `server.js`, install dependencies:
```
bash
   npm install
   
```
### Running the Application

You can run the application by serving the static files using a local web server.

- **Using `server.js` (if included):**
```
bash
  node server.js
  
```
Then open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in `server.js`).

- **Using a simple HTTP server:**
  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:
  - With Python 3: `python -m http.server`
  - With Node.js `http-server` (install globally with `npm install -g http-server`): `http-server`
  - Using a Live Server VS Code extension.

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Data Storage

All content data, including movies, anime, web series, comments, media information, and user requests, is stored in static JSON files within the `data/` directory. This approach is suitable for smaller projects or for demonstration purposes.

## Content Management

Currently, content management is handled through manual editing of the JSON files and the admin panel within the application.

As suggested in the project documentation, for more efficient and scalable content management, consider integrating with a Git-based Headless CMS. This would allow for a more user-friendly interface for content creators and a more structured workflow.
